# Market_plus_Basket
## AIM: 
In this data science project, we will learn how to perform market basket analysis with the application of Apriori and FP growth algorithms based on the concept of association rule learning.
## Description:
Imagine that you are a restaurant sales manager, and a customer has asked you to recommend a few dishes from the menu. What do you do in such a scenario? Simple! You use the market basket analysis technique to deduce the recommendations so that customers are more likely to buy your recommended dish. This project will help you understand market basket analysis (MBA) with examples, its advantages, and the different types of MBA. In the end, you will find a brief overview of the MBAÂ project solution.
## What we will learn:
  - Introduction to Market Basket Analysis
  - Association rules
  - Parameters of association rules
  - Apriori algorithm
  - Fpgrowth algorithm
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Univariate analysis
  - Bivariate analysis
  - Identifying top selling products & departments
  - Creating baskets for analysis
  - Feature engineering
  - One hot encoding
  - Difference between apriori and fpgrowth algorithms.
  - Support, lift, and confidence in relation to association rules
  - Comparing time taken to run apriori and fpgrowth algorithms
